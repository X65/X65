## Key Topics Covered

- The **vision and goals** behind the X65 project
- The **65C816 CPU**, its advantages, and how it operates in **native mode from boot-up**
- The **memory model**, including flat 16MB addressing and efficient direct page handling
- The **graphics system**, which uses a **beam-chased display list** instead of a framebuffer
- The **sound system**, leveraging a Yamaha SD-1 FM synthesizer for rich audio
- **Peripheral support**, expansion options, and system input/output design

By the end of Part 1, readers will have a complete understanding of the **X65â€™s architecture** and what makes it a powerful yet accessible computing platform.

## What to Expect Next

In the following chapters, we will dive into the **technical architecture** of the X65, exploring how its components interact and how it provides a unique platform for low-level programming and hardware experimentation.
