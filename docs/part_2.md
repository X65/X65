### Part 2: Programming the X65 in 65816 Assembly

The second half of the book is dedicated to **writing software for the X65** using **65816 assembly language**. This section provides a structured learning path, covering everything from the basics of the instruction set to advanced optimization techniques. Topics include:

- An introduction to **65816 assembly syntax and structure**
- Working with **registers, addressing modes, and stack operations**
- Handling **memory efficiently** in a flat 16MB address space
- Programming the **graphics system** using the display list
- Generating **sound with the Yamaha SD-1 FM synthesizer**
- Interfacing with **peripherals and expansion hardware**
- **Optimizing code** for performance and efficiency

By the end of Part 2, readers will have the knowledge required to **develop software, games, and applications** for the X65, as well as extend its capabilities through custom hardware and expansion modules.
